# ToDoListApp
## Intro
A to-do list app allows you to organize a project or a series of tasks while keeping track of things such as a due date,
checklists and priority labels. Each project can be toggled through so that the todos in each project list can be viewed on the webpage. The app also supports localStorage 
so that users can save their todos on their computers when they refresh or close the browser. 
## Skills Demonstrated
This project shows skills in DOM manipulation, using design techniques such as factories, modules or classes.
I emphasized the single responsibility responsible from the SOLID principles.
